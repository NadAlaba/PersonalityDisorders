Personality Disorders

_Preface (Syn Ch6):
1. Personality disorders are characterized by deeply engrained, generally lifelong maladaptive patterns of behavior that are usually recognizable at adolescence or earlier.


_Brief close-up Introduction:
(Syn Ch22)
-General Personality Disorder: An enduring pattern of behavior and inner experiences that deviates significantly from the individual's cultural standards; is rigidly pervasive; has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood; is stable through time; leads to unhappines and impairment; and manifests in at least 2 of the following 4 areas: cognition, affectivity, interpersonal function, or impulse control.
-When Personality traits are rigid and maladaptive and produce functional impairment or subjective distress, a PD is diagnosed.


Cluster A: Odd and aloof features (Syn Ch22)
(Syn Ch6)
1. Paranoid Personality Disorder: is characterized by unwarranted suspicion, hypersensitivity, jealousy, envy, rigidity, excessive self-importance, and a tendency to blame and ascribe evil motives to others.
2. Schizoid Personality Disorder: is characterized by shyness, oversensitivity, seclusiveness, avoidance of close or competitive relationships, eccentricity, no loss of capacity to recognize reality, daydreaming and an ability to express hostility and aggression.
3. Schizotypal Personality Disorder: is similar to schizoid personality, but the person also exhibits slight losses of reality testing, has odd beliefs, and is aloof and withdrawn.

Cluster B: Dramatic, Impulsive and erratic features (Syn Ch22)
(Syn Ch6)
4. Histrionic Personality Disorder: is characterized by emotional instability, excitability, over-reactivity, vanity, immaturity, dependency, and self-dramatization that is attention seeking and seductive.
5. Antisocial Personality Disorder: covers persons in conflict with society. They are incapable of loyalty, selfish, callous, irresponsible, impulsive, and unable to feel guilt or learn from experiences; they have low levels of frustration tolerance and a tendency to blame others.
6. Narcissistic Personality Disorder: is characterized by grandiose feelings, a sense of entitlement, a lack of empathy, envy and a tendency to blame others.
7. Borderline Personality Disorder: is characterized by instability, impulsiveness, chaotic sexuality, suicidal acts, self-mutilating behavior, identity problems, ambivalence, and feeling of emptiness and boredom.

Cluster C: anxious and fearful features (Syn Ch22)
(Syn Ch6)
8. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD): is characterized by excessive concern with conformity and standards of conscience; the individual may be rigid, overconscientious, overdutiful, overinhibited, and unable to relax (three Ps - punctual, parsimonius and precise).
9. Avoidant Personality Disorder: is characterized by low levels of energy, easy fatigability, lack of enthusiasm, inability to enjoy life and oversensitivity to stress.
10. Dependent Personality Disorder:is characterized by passive and submissive behavior; the person is unsure of himself or herself and becomes entirely dependent on others.

Personality Changes Due to Another Medical Condition: This category includes alterations to a personality due to a medical condition (e.g, brain tumor).
Unspecified Personality Disorder: This category involves other personality traits that do not fit any of the patterns described above.

_Etiology:
(Syn Ch22)
1. Genetic factors: Evidence that GFs contribute to PDs comes from investigations of more that 15,000 pairs of twins in the US, where the concordance of PDs among monozygotic twins was several times that among dizygotic twins. Moreover, according to 1 study, monozygotic twins reared apart are about as similar as monozygotic twins reared together.
-Cluster A PDs are more common in the biological relatives of patients with schizophrenia than in control groups. Correlation between schizotypal PD and schizophrenia is more than in between paranoid or schizoid PD and Schizophrenia.
-Cluster B PDs: Depression is common in the family backgrounds of patients with Borderline PD, and these patients have more relatives with mood disorders than do control groups, and persons with borderline PD often have a mood disorder as well. {Antisocial PD is associated with alcohol use disorders. A strong association is found between histrionic disorder and somatization disorder (Briquet's syndrome).}
{-Cluster C PDs: Patients with Avoidant PD often have high anxiety levels. Patients with OCPD show some signs associated with depression, e.g, shortened REM latency period and abnormal dexamethasone suppression test (DST) results.}

2. Biological factors:
-Hormones: Persons who exhibit impulsive traits also often show high levels of testosterone, 17-estradiol, and esterone. In nonhuman primates androgens increase the likelihood of aggression and sexual behavior, but the role of testosterone in human aggression is unclear. DST results are abnormal in some patients with borderline PD who also have depressive symptoms.
-Platelet Monoamine Oxidase:Low MAO levels have been noted in some patients with scizotypal disorders.
-Smooth Pursuit Eye Movements:Smooth Pursuit eye movements are saccadic (jumpy) in persons who are [introverted], who have [low self-esteem] and [tend to withdraw], and who have schizotypal [personality disorder]. These findings have no clinical application, but they do indicate the role of inheritance.
-Neurotransmitters: Endorphines (and exogenous morphine) have an arousal suppression effect, also high endogenous endorphin levels may be associated with persons who are phlegmatic. Studies of personality traits and the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems indicate an arousal-activating function for these neurotransmitters. Levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a metabolite of serotonin, are low in persons who attempt suicide and in patients who are impulsive and aggressive, also, raising serotonin with serotonergic agents such as fluoxetine (Prozac) can produce dramatic changes in some character traits of personality. In many persons, serotonin reduces depression, impulsiveness, and rumination and can produce a sense of general well-being. Increased dopamine concentrations in the CNS produced by certain psychostimulants (Amphetamines) can induce euphoria.
-Electrophysiology: Changes in electrical conductance on the electroencephalogram (EEG) occur in some patients with personality disorders, most commonly antisocial and borderline types; these changes appear as slow-wave activity on EEGs.

3. Psychoanalytic factors:

_Epidemiology:
(Syn Ch22)
-Personality disorders occur in 10 to 20 percent of the general population.
-Approximately %50 of all psychiatric patients have a personality disorder, which is frequently comorbid with other clinical syndromes.
-Personality disorder is also a predisposing factor for other psychiatric disorders (e.g, substance use, suicide, affective disorders, impulse-control disorders, eating disorders, and anxiety disorders) in which it interferes with treatment outcomes of many clinical syndromes and increases personal incapacitation, morbidity, and mortality of these patients.

_Notes:
(Syn Ch22)
-Persons with personality disorders are far more likely to refuse psychiatric help and to deny their problems than persons with anxiety disorders, depressive disorder or OCD.
-In general, personality disorder symptoms are ego syntonic (i.e, acceptable to the ego, as opposed to ego dystonic) and alloplastic (i.e, adapt by trying to alter the external environment rather than themselves).
-Persons with PD do not feel anxiety about their maladaptive behavior.
-Individuals frequently exhibit traits that are not limited to a single PD.

Paranoid Personality Disorder:
-Persons with paranoid PD are characterized by long-standing suspiciousness and mistrust of persons in general. They refuse responsibility for their own feelings and assign responsibility to others. They are often hostile, irritable, and angry. Bigots, injustice collectors, pathologically jealous spouses, and litigious cranks often have paranoid PD.

    _Epidemiology:
    -Prevalence of paranoid PD is %(2-4) of the general population.
    -Relatives of patients with schizophrenia show a higher incidence of paranoid PD than control participants. Some evidence suggests a more specific familial relationship with delusional disorder, persecutory type.
    -The disorder is more commonly diagnosed in men than in women in clinical samples.
    -{The prevalence among persons who are homosexual is no higher than usual, as once thought}, but it is believed to be higher among minority groups, immigrants, and persons who are deaf than it is in the general population.

    _Diagnosis:
    -On psychiatric examination, patients with paranoid PD may be formal in manner and act baffled about having to seek psychiatric help.
    -Muscular tension, an inability to relax, and a need to scan the environment for clues may be evident, and the patient's manner is often humorless and serious.
    -Although some premises of their arguments may be false, their speech is goal directed and logical. Their thought content shows evidence of projection, prejudice, and occasional ideas of reference.

    _Criteria: DSM-5

    _Clinical features:
    -The hallmarks of paranoid PD are excessive suspiciousness and distrust of others expressed as a pervasive tendency to interpret actions of others as deliberately demeaning, malevolent, threatening, exploiting, or deceiving.
    -This tendency begins by early adulthood and appears in a variety of contexts.
    -Almost invariably, those with the disorder expect to be exploited or harmed by others in some way. They frequently dispute, without any justification, friends' or associates' loyalty or trustworthiness.
    -They are often pathologically jealous and for no reason, question the fidelity of their spouses or sexual partners.
    -They externalize their own emotions and use the defense of projection; they attribute to others the impulses and thoughts that they cannot accept in themselves.
    -Ideas of reference and logically defended illusions are common.
    -They are affectively restricted and appear to be unemotional. They pride themselves on being rational and objective, but such is not the case.
    -They lack warmth and are impressed with, and pay close attention to ,power and rank. They express disdain for those they see as weak, sickly, impaired, or in some way defective.
    -In social situations, persons with paranoid PD may appear business-like and efficient, but they often generate fear or conflict in others.

    _Differential Diagnosis:
    -paranoid PD can usually be differentiated from delusional disorder by the absence of fixed delusions.
    -Unlike paranoid schizophrenia, those with PDs have no hallucinations or formal thought disorder.
    -Paranoid PD can be distinguished from borderline PD because patients who are paranoid are rarely capable of overly involved, tumultuous relationships with others.
    -Patients with paranoia lack the long history of antisocial behavior of persons with antisocial character.
    -Persons with schizoid personality disorder are withdrawn and aloof and do not have paranoid ideation.

    _Course and Prognosis:
    -{In some studies, paranoid PD is lifelong; in others, it is a harbinger of schizophrenia.
    -In still other studies, paranoid traits give way to reaction formation, appropriate concern with morality, and alturistic concerns as they mature or as stress diminishes.}
    -In general, those with paranoid PD have lifelong problems working and living with others. Occupational and marital problems are common.

    _Treatment:
        _Psychotherapy:
        -It is the treatment of choice.
        -Therapists should be straightforward in all their dealings with these patients. If a therapist is accused of inconsistency or a fault, such as lateness for an appointment, honesty and an apology are preferable to a defensive explanation. Therapists must remember that trust and toleration of intimacy are troubled areas for patients with this disorder.
        -Individual psychotherapy thus requires a professional and not overly warm style from therapists.
        -Patients usually do not do well in group therapy, although it can be useful for improving social skills and diminishing suspiciousness.
        -Many can not tolerate the intrusiveness of behavior therapy, also used for social skills training.
        -Delusional accusations must be dealt with realistically but gently and without humiliating patients.
        -Patients who are paranoid are profoundly frightened when they feel that those trying to help them are weak and helpless; therefore, therapists should never offer to take control unless they are willing and able to do so.

        _Pharmacotherapy:
        -It is useful in dealing with agitation and anxiety. In most cases, an antianxiety agent such as diazepam (Valium) suffices.
        -It may be necessary to use an antipsychotic such as haloperidol (Haldol) in small dosages and for brief periods to manage severe agitation or quasi-delusional thinking. Pimozide (Orap) has successfully reduced paranoid ideation in some patients.
        
    _Notes:
    Those with paranoid PD rarely seek treatment themselves; when referred to treatment by a spouse or an employer, they can often pull them-selves together and appear undistressed.

Schizoid Personality Disorder:
-Schizoid PD is characterized by a lifelong pattern of social withdrawal. Persons with schizoid PD are often seen by others as eccentric, isolated, or lonely. Their discomfort with human interaction; their introversion; and their bland, constricted affect are noteworthy.

    _Epidemiology:
    -The disorder may affect %5 of the general population.
    -The sex ratio of the disorder is unknown; some studies report a 2:1 male:to female ratio.
    
    _Diagnosis:
    -On an initial examination, patients with schizoid PD may appear ill at ease. They rarely tolerate eye contact, and interviewers may surmise that such patients are eager for the interview to end.
    -Their affect may be constricted, aloof, or inappropriately serious, but underneath the aloofness, sensitive clinicians can recognize fear.
    -Their efforts at humor may seem adolescent and off the mark. Their speech is goal directed, but they are likely to give short answers to questions and to avoid spontaneous conversation.
    -They may occasionally use unusual figures of speech, such as an odd metaphor, and may be fascinated with inanimate objects or metaphysical constructs.
    -They may have an unwarranted sense of intimacy with persons they do not know well or whom they have not seen for a long time.
    -Their sensorium is intact, their memory functions well, and their proverb interpretations are abstract.

    _Criteria: DSM-5

    _Clinical features:
    -Persons with schizoid PD seem to be cold and aloof; they display a remote reserve and show no involvement with everyday events and the concerns of others. They appear quiet, distant, seclusive, and unsociable.
    -They may pursue their own lives with remarkably little need or longing for emotional ties and they are the last to be aware of changes in popular fashion.
    -The life histories of such persons reflect solitary interests and success at noncompetitive, lonely jobs that others find difficult to tolerate.
    -Their sexual lives may exist exclusively in fantasy, and they may postpone mature sexuality indefinitely.
    -Men may not marry because they are unable to achieve intimacy; women may passively agree to marry an agressive man who wants the marriage.
    -They can invest enormous affective energy in nonhuman interests, such as mathematics and astronomy, and they may be very attached to animals.
    -Dietary and health fads, philosophical movements, and social improvement schemes, especially those that require no personal involvement, often engross them.
    -Persons with schizoid PD usually reveal a lifelong inability to express anger directly, and because aggressive acts are rarely included in their repertoire of usual responses, most threats, real or imagined, are dealt with by fantasized omnipotence or resignation.
    -Although persons with schizoid PD appear self-absorbed and lost in daydreams, they have a normal capacity to recognize reality, and although they are often seen as aloof, yet such persons can sometimes conceive, develop, and give to the world genuinely original, creative ideas.

    _Differential Diagnosis:
    -Schizoid PD is distinguished from schizophrenia, delusional disorder and affective disorder with psychotic features based on periods with psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations in the latter.
    -Although patients with paranoid PD share many traits with those with schizoid PD, the former exhibit more social engagement, a history of aggressive verbal behavior, and a greater tendency to project their feelings onto others.
    -Theoretically, the chief distinction between a patient with schizotypal PD and one with schizoid PD is that the patient who is schizotypal is more similar to a patient with schizophrenia in oddities of perception, thought, behavior, and communication.
    -If just as emotionally constricted, patients with obsessive-compulsive and avoidant PDs experience loneliness as dysphoric, possess a richer history of past object relations, and do not engage as much in autistic reverie.
    -Patients with avoidant PD are isolated but strongly wish to participate in activities, a characteristic absent in those with schizoid PD.
    -Schizoid PD is distinguished from autistic disorder and Asperger's syndrome by more severely impaired social interactions and stereotypical behaviors and interests than in those 2 disorders.

    _Course and Prognosis:
    -The onset of schizoid PD usually occurs in early chilhood or adolescence.
    -As with all PDs, schizoid PD is long lasting but not necessarily lifelong.
    -The proportion of patients who incur schizophrenia is unknown.

    _Treatment:
        _Psychotherapy:
        -Patients who are schizoid tend toward introspection; however, these tendencies are consistent with psychotherapists' expectations, and such patients may become devoted, if distant patients.
        -As trust develops, patients who are schizoid may, with great trepidation, reveal a plethora of fantasies, imaginary friends, and fears of unbearable dependence, even of merging with the therapist.
        -In group therapy settings, patients with scizoid PD may be silent for long periods; nonetheless, they do become involved. The patients should be protected against aggressive attack by group members for their proclivity to be silent.
        -With time, the group members become important to patients who are schizoid and may provide the only social contact in their otherwise isolated existence.

        _Pharmacotherapy:
        -Pharmacotherapy with small dosages of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and psychostimulants has benefitted some patients.
        -Serotonergic agents may make patients less sensitive to rejection.
        -Benzodiazepines may help diminish interpersonal anxiety.
